**pwncat-vl** is a community-maintained fork of [pwncat-cs](https://github.com/calebstewart/pwncat), revived to support **modern Python versions (3.9 to 3.14)** and ensure the tool remains usable for current red team workflows.

---

Originally created by [@calebstewart](https://github.com/calebstewart), `pwncat` is a post-exploitation platform ~~for Linux targets~~.
It started out as a wrapper around basic bind and reverse shells and has grown from there. It streamlines common red team operations while staging code from your attacker machine, not the target.

The original project has been unmaintained since 2021, and despite community interest and open pull requests, no updates were made.
Rather than let the project fade away, this fork was created to **fix critical issues, restore compatibility, and keep contributions alive**.

### Key changes in this fork:
- Python **3.9 to 3.14** compatibility (tested in CI)
- **Busybox/Alpine PTY support** - automatically uploads a minimal static binary to spawn a real PTY on systems that lack `script`, `python`, and other standard tools (supports x86_64, aarch64, i686, armv7l)
- Replaced deprecated dependencies (`netifaces` -> `psutil`, `zodburi` -> direct ZODB, `pkg_resources` -> `importlib.resources`)
- Fixed critical bugs (resource leaks, broken error handling, shell injection)
- Updated dependencies for modern environments
- 46+ unit tests running across all supported Python versions
- Active maintenance (contributions welcome!)

### Features

pwncat intercepts the raw communication with a remote shell and allows the
user to perform automated actions on the remote host including enumeration,
implant installation and even privilege escalation.

After receiving a connection, pwncat will configure the remote shell:

- Disable shell history
- Normalize shell prompt
- Locate useful binaries (using `which`)
- Attempt to spawn a pseudo-terminal (pty) for full interactive sessions

`pwncat` supports multiple methods for spawning PTYs and cross-references them with available executables on the target system.
After spawning a PTY, it sets the terminal in raw mode to mimic the behavior of an `ssh` session.

It also synchronizes the remote PTY settings (rows, columns, `TERM`) with your local terminal to ensure proper behavior of interactive applications like `vim` or `nano`.

#### Busybox/Alpine support

Unlike the upstream project, `pwncat-vl` can spawn a full PTY on **minimal environments** like Alpine Linux containers or embedded busybox systems where `script`, `python`, and other standard PTY-spawning tools are unavailable. When all standard methods fail, pwncat automatically detects the remote architecture and uploads a tiny static binary (~30KB) that allocates a real PTY via `forkpty()`. The binary is written to `/dev/shm` (RAM) when possible, self-deletes after exec, and uses a randomized filename.

### Platform Support

`pwncat` was initially Linux-only, but the original maintainers began introducing **alpha support for Windows targets**.
This fork continues to support these efforts but does not introduce new Windows features (yet).

with full respect and credit given to the original work. Contributions are welcome, and maintenance is ongoing as time permits.


## Installation

`pwncat` only depends on a working Python development environment running on Linux.
In order to install some of the packages required with `pip`, you will likely need
your distribution's "Python Development" package. On Debian based systems,
this is `python-dev`. For Arch, the development files are shipped with the
main Python repository. For Enterprise Linux, the package is named
`python-devel`.

You can install `pwncat-vl` easily using `pipx` (recommended if you want isolation without managing virtualenvs manually):

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/Chocapikk/pwncat-vl
```

If you prefer manual installation from source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Chocapikk/pwncat-vl.git
cd pwncat-vl
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install .
```

For a development environment, `pwncat` uses Python Poetry. You can clone the
repository locally and use Poetry to set up a development environment:

```shell
# Setup pwncat-vl inside a poetry-managed virtual environment
git clone https://github.com/Chocapikk/pwncat-vl.git
cd pwncat-vl
poetry install

# Enter the virtual environment
poetry shell
```

## Naming

Due to naming conflicts with [Cytopia's pwncat](https://pwncat.org/), the original project was renamed `pwncat-cs`.
This fork uses the name **`pwncat-vl`** with the entrypoint `pwncat-vl`.

## Windows Support

`pwncat` supports connections from Windows targets starting at `v0.4.0a1`. The Windows
platform utilizes a .Net-based C2 library which is loaded automatically. Windows
targets should connect with either a `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe` shell, and
pwncat will take care of the rest.

The libraries implementing the C2 are implemented at [pwncat-windows-c2].
The DLLs for the C2 will be automatically downloaded from the targeted release
for you. If you do not have internet connectivity on your target machine,
you can tell pwncat to pre-stage the DLLs using the `--download-plugins`
argument. If you are running a release version of pwncat, you can also download
a tarball of all built-in plugins from the releases page.

The plugins are stored by default in `~/.local/share/pwncat`, however this is
configurable with the `plugin_path` configuration. If you download the packaged
set of plugins from the releases page, you should extract it to the path pointed
to by `plugin_path`.

Aside from the main C2 DLLs, other plugins may also be available. Currently,
the only provided default plugins are the C2 and an implementation of [BadPotato].
pwncat can reflectively load .Net binaries to be used as plugins for the C2.
For more information on Windows C2 plugins, please see the [documentation].

## Modules

The architecture of the pwncat framework uses a generic "module" structure. All functionality is
implemented as modules. This includes enumeration, persistence and
privilege escalation. Interacting with modules is similar to most other
post-exploitation platforms. You can utilize the familiar `run`, `search`
and `info` commands and enter module contexts with the `use` command.
Refer to the documentation for more information.

### Connecting to a Victim

The command line parameters for pwncat attempt to be flexible and accept
a variety of common connection syntax. Specifically, it will try to accept
common netcat and ssh like syntax. The following are all valid:

```sh
# Connect to a bind shell
pwncat-vl connect://10.10.10.10:4444
pwncat-vl 10.10.10.10:4444
pwncat-vl 10.10.10.10 4444
# Listen for reverse shell
pwncat-vl bind://0.0.0.0:4444
pwncat-vl 0.0.0.0:4444
pwncat-vl :4444
pwncat-vl -lp 4444
# Connect via ssh
pwncat-vl ssh://user:password@10.10.10.10
pwncat-vl user@10.10.10.10
pwncat-vl user:password@10.10.10.10
pwncat-vl -i id_rsa user@10.10.10.10
# SSH w/ non-standard port
pwncat-vl -p 2222 user@10.10.10.10
pwncat-vl user@10.10.10.10:2222
# Reconnect utilizing installed persistence
#   If reconnection fails and no protocol is specified,
#   SSH is used as a fallback.
pwncat-vl reconnect://user@10.10.10.10
pwncat-vl reconnect://user@c228fc49e515628a0c13bdc4759a12bf
pwncat-vl user@10.10.10.10
pwncat-vl c228fc49e515628a0c13bdc4759a12bf
pwncat-vl 10.10.10.10
```

By default, pwncat **assumes the target platform is Linux**. In order to
connect to a Windows reverse or bind shell, you must pass the `--platform/-m`
argument:

```shell
pwncat-vl -m windows 10.10.10.10 4444
pwncat-vl -m windows -lp 4444
```

For more information on the syntax and argument handling, see the
help information with ``pwncat-vl --help`` or visit the [documentation].

## Docker Image

The recommended installation method is a Python virtual environment. This
provides the easiest day-to-day usage of `pwncat`. However, there has been
interest in using `pwncat` from a docker image, so a Dockerfile is provided
which builds a working `pwncat` installation. To build the image use:

```shell
docker build -t pwncat .
```

This will build the `pwncat` docker image with the tag "pwncat". The working
directory within the container is `/work`. The entrypoint for the container
is the `pwncat-vl` binary. It can be used like so:

```shell
# Connect to a bind shell at 10.0.0.1:4444
docker run -v "/some/directory":/work -t pwncat 10.0.0.1 4444
```

In this example, only the files in `/some/directory` are exposed to the container.
Obviously, for upload/download, the container will only be able to see the files
exposed through any mounted directories.

## Features and Functionality

`pwncat` provides two main features. At its core, its goal is to automatically
setup a remote PseudoTerminal (pty) which allows interaction with the remote
host much like a full SSH session. When operating in a pty, you can use common
features of your remote shell such as history, line editing, and graphical
terminal applications.

The other half of `pwncat` is a framework which utilizes your remote shell to
perform automated enumeration, persistence and privilege escalation tasks. The
local `pwncat` prompt provides a number of useful features for standard
penetration tests including:

* File upload and download
* Automated privilege escalation enumeration
* Automated privilege escalation execution
* Automated persistence installation/removal
* Automated tracking of modified/created files
    * `pwncat` also offers the ability to revert these remote "tampers" automatically

The underlying framework for interacting with the remote host aims to abstract
away the underlying shell and connection method as much as possible, allowing
commands and plugins to interact seamlessly with the remote host.

You can learn more about interacting with `pwncat` and about the underlying framework
in the [documentation]. If you have an idea for a new privilege escalation method
or persistence method, please take a look at the API documentation specifically.
